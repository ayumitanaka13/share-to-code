## About

### What is this app?

This is a web app that helps beginners to learn to code.
Users can post roadmaps on how to learn with text and YouTube videos after sign up. Also, users can search roadmaps with a keyword.

### Why I created this app?

I created this app to learn how to build a MERN stack app. Since it was nearly my first time combining server-side and client-side, creating this app was a good opportunity to expand my skills.

### How I build this app?

This app is a CRUD app that is combined server-side such as MongoDB, Node.js, and Express and client-side such as React, and Redux.  

Thanks to the helpful library called React Google Login, it saved my time a lot. It made me create Google Auth part much easier than before.
