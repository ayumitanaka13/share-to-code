# Japanese City Pop

## About

### What is this app?

This is a web app that recommends you to listen to Japanese city pop music!
Users can leave comments on their favorite artist's page and save their favorite albums after sign up.

### Why I created this app?

I created this app to learn how the web app works.
Since I've been learning front-end, I wasn't familiar with back-end.
Creating this app was a good opportunity to learn to code with Python Flask, and to use Postgresql.

### How I build this app?

This app is nearly a CRUD app that has MVC architecture.
I said nearly because this app doesn't allow users to delete user's info.
So this is an upcoming feature!

Thanks to the Flask Blueprint module, I partitioned app functions as small as possible.
As a result, I improved the maintainability of this app.
